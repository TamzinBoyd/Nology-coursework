- 2 teams
- 2 Buttons, add +1 to score for the relevant team
- End Game to reset scores

MAKING FUNCTIONS PURE
No side effects (don't alter global variables)

ISSUES
Whilst making pure, cannot get the 2nd button to add anything after the 1st click - only 1st click seems to work
Can't figure out how to alter score when it's not a global variable
