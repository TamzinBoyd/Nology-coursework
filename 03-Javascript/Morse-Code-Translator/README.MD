CHALLENGE - Create a morse code translator using OOP.

STEP ONE - RESEARCH MORSE CODE TRANSLATION
Each letter has a morse code equivalent, these are combined to make words. Using . & -

DESIGN & CONTENT

- An input box for user to enter their text
- Output box to display translation (may also be needed for morse code entry)
- Button to activate the translate OR show translation as type
- Design mobile first

FUNCTONALITY

1. User enters value via input box, convert to string
2. Split into characters. Translations stored in an object.
3. Map over object to find the key and return translation
4. Display results to user
   Morse to English will be different as user will need to separate characters by space

STILL TO DO

1. Get functionality of Morse to English working
2. If translation appears as user types, remove "translate" button
3. Test functions
