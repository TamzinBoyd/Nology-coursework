Set myself the challenge of creating a random Pokemon generator using a public API.

Fetch request taken from pokeapi.co
Used documentation and support of other sites to discover how to drill through the object to access desired values.

Once I found how to access the Pokemon based on an ID I needed a way to make this random. I set the ID within the object to generate a random number, so each time the page loads this changes.

Added a click event to the button to reload the page and generate a random Pokemon each click.

Added simple styling using official Pokemon colours.
