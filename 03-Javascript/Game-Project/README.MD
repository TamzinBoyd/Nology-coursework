PROJECT BREIF

Create an interactive game using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT

SHORT STORY

INITIAL STEPS / LONG STORY

Decided on a missing item game, where the user finds the snakes they are removed from the image.

Firstly I played around with basic functions to practise layering elements. I knew that on click I would need to hide an element.

I soon realised it was best to add the image as the same size each time, therefore I needed a different way to activate the click event. I opted for a checkbox in the same location as the hidden item and set opacity to 0.

Created a click event to add a class which displayed none, therefore hiding the element. Even if user clicked again it wouldn't reappear.

Once happy with the core functionality it was time for the design! I opted for a cartoon style image, targeting more at children. I created a variety of pets using Affinity Photo.

Created a preview of the items to find at a reduced opacity, when user finds a snake the related item will add a class to make it full opacity.

Not wanting to make the game too easy I added a timer. Here I learnt about the setInterval method.
