BRIEF

Create a text based alien shooting game
3 types of ship holding different hit scores
When a ship is hit the points are deducted
Game over is when all ships have 0 points left

FUNCTIONALITY

I want to store each ship in an Object, created from a class as all keys will be the same for each ship.
Need to be able to store current points for each ship.
Button to generate a random number/ship allocation
When the ship is hit, access the object to deduct points and update current points
Recognise when all current points are 0 and show "game over"
