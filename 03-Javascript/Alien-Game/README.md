BRIEF

Create a text based/basic alien shooting game
3 types of ships holding different hit scores
When a ship is hit the points are deducted

Game over is when all ships have 0 points left or Mother ship has 0 points

FUNCTIONALITY

I want to store each ship in an Object, created from a class as all keys will be the same for each ship.
Need to be able to store current points for each ship.
Button to generate a random number/ship allocation to hit.
When the ship is hit, access the object to deduct points and update current points.
Recognise when all current points are 0/Mother ship 0 and show "game over - you've won".
When a ship reaches 0 points a ship on HTML needs a hidden classlist.

OTHER ADDITIONS?
Consider time limit?
