BRIEF

Create a text based/basic alien shooting game
3 types of ships holding different hit scores
When a ship is hit the points are deducted

Game over is when all ships have 0 points or Mother ship has 0 points

FUNCTIONALITY

I want to store each ship in an Object, created from a class as all keys will be the same for each ship.
Method to calculate current points based on points minus hit deduct points.
Button to generate a random ship allocation to hit.
When the ship is hit, access the object to deduct points and update current points.
When a ship reaches 0 points, link to HTML and add a hidden class
Recognise when all current points are 0/Mother ship 0 and show "game over - you've won".
Restart button to start the game again


IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

- Carry out unit testing once functioning
- Add timer
- Add animation for shooting action
