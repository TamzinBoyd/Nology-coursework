Clean and simple layout with a retro twist.

In the future I want to be able to enable a 'light-mode' where the user can use to change colours to a pale 
pastel palette.

When click on project it opens a pop up describing project info, programmes used etc

Look to increase interactivity such as rotating triagles on hover

Still need to separate SCSS documents
